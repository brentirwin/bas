Due to unforeseen technical difficulties, we regrettably will not be releasing an episode of The Brent and Skye Show this week. We will return next week on Thanksgiving Day with our book report episode featuring *The Silent Scream* by Diane Hoh.

The digital recording device I use to record podcasts broke just before recording this episode. There are other options for recording, but we did not have a contingency plan in place. Thank you for your patience. We will have a new temporary recording solution ready by next week.

I have had this recorder since the original days of The Brent and Skye Show. Over the past 12 years I have used it for podcasting, piano, sound effects, and theatre work. I hope I will be able to replace this crucial piece of equipment soon.
